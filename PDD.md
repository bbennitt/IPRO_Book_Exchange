# IPRO 497 Fall 2022 – Group E's Product Design Document 

## Problem Statements

College students often struggle with buying expensive textbooks. College students within a chosen radius are able to exchange books or buy them cheaper to gain access to textbooks and decrease piracy.

College students can use our solution to help them buy and sell used textbooks for better prices than are offered by existing e-retailers. As a result of lower buying and higher selling prices, students are more likely to purchase and read textbooks, increasing their grades and overall knowledge in the process.

## Top Application Capabilities
1. Optimize access from phone (college students almost always have their phones on them) (move this)
2. Search for books with search bar (ISBN, name, author, edition) 
3. Set up a pick-up or meeting location at a bookstore between the seller and buyer.
    - Seller can drop books to the bookstore(?other places) and buyer can pick it up later.
4. Buyer can save book for later, pin it, or get notification about it. (sold, etc.)
5. Buyer can change the radius for location (search for books in longer distances.)
6. Account system for buyers and sellers. (past history, rating)
7. Implement a messaging system, buyer and seller can communicate.
8. Show past prices for books, or prices from other sellers and bookstore/amazon. (price history for the book)
9. If we don’t have the book, suggest to buy an older version from the bookstore.

## Team Working Agreement (All team members)
### What do we want to accomplish/learn together?

### Tools
* We will use Github and keep items updated as progress is made
* If we need to meet outside of class we will use the following tool/tech for meetings: Discord/Zoom
* When we are not meeting together we will use the following tool/tech for communications: Discord

### Requested Approach/Behavior 
* If we need to meet outside of class we have found a mutually agreeable time at: (Not Decided Yet)

* Any change to the repository needs to be communicated on Discord
* Each story should be a separate branch. Before merging the branches, the story owner requests a Pull Request. After PR, the story owner can merge the branch.
* Acknowledge everyone’s work.
* No questions asked should be considered silly.
* Respect needs to be present at all times.

### Unacceptable behavior
...

### How will we productively solve disagreement
* If 100% of the group does not agree with some decision after 10 minutes of discussion, a poll will be made
