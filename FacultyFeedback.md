# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.

## Week 8 ##
- Problem statement should open with a problem - "textbooks are so expensively they are barely affordable.."
- You are a two sided exchange with buyers and seller
- Like the bulleted form of the user scenario (and the getting money for new textbooks)
- Transaction fee means you would have build an payment system - so exchange is a good call.
- Orange on yellow seems hard to read to me
- Demo was a static local page so not really a coded demo
